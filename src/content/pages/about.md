## Our History

Albert Shirian has been in real estate development for 30 years. His career began in 1984, two years after he graduated college. His first project was a ground-up two family home in Glen Cove, NY. He did that venture alone, along with another six single and two family home projects on the North Shore of Long Island. In 1986 his brother, Ramin joined him and Lions Group was born. For the following decade Lions Group filled the niche of ground up developers of single-family homes on Long Island, gradually increasing the size and scope of projects and eventually developing prime real estate on the gold coast of Long Island and the South Shore, primarily Long Beach. In the early 90’s, Lions Group began building two and three family homes in areas of Queens such as Woodside, Bayside and Flushing.

The size of their developments continued to grow until they were building housing structures for up to eight families. In the late 90’s, Lions Group ventured to develop what, at the time, seemed like a large project: a 30-unit, 6-story residential building in Kew Gardens. After having success in Kew Gardens, Lions Group was eager to expand further. They next built a 7-story building on Mulberry Street in Lower Manhattan, which was completed in 2004. After this tipping point, the following four years included the developments of 44-27 Purves St. (15 stories, 65 units), 10-50 Jackson Ave. (12 stories, 49 units), and Briar Manor (6 stories, 41 units). Today, Lions Group continues to grow their company. Currently developing projects that contain over 100 units, and expand across the five boroughs of New York.
